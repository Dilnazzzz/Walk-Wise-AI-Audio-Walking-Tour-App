# WalkWise AI-powered Urban Exploration App

This project introduces an innovative mobile application designed to transform urban exploration with AI-powered audio walking tours. Addressing the limitations of conventional walking tours, this app offers a personalized, immersive experience, providing real-time audio narratives tailored to users' preferences, pace, and interests.

The app’s initial release has showcased its potential to redefine city exploration. Users can discover local attractions, explore neighborhoods, and enjoy customized audio tours directly from their mobile devices. By integrating AI technologies, the app dynamically adjusts content, ensuring each tour remains engaging and relevant to the user's unique interests.

Currently, the app integrates React Native for cross-platform development and utilizes APIs like Google Maps and TripAdvisor for location-based services. Firebase handles authentication and database management, ensuring a secure and responsive experience. The project is following Agile methodologies, focusing on continuous user feedback, adaptability, and iterative improvement.

As an MVP, the app lays the groundwork for future features, such as deeper integration with local businesses, personalized carbon-tracking rewards, and expanding the scope of urban impact through community-driven contributions. This initial release sets the stage for scaling the platform to support a more sustainable, interactive, and rewarding urban exploration experience.
