# WalkWise AI-Powered Urban Exploration & Engagement App

This project introduces an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize urban exploration by combining AI-powered walking tours with tokenized incentives and community-driven engagement. The app offers a personalized, immersive experience, providing real-time audio narratives and rewards tailored to users’ preferences, pace, and interests, while empowering them to contribute to city improvements.

The app’s initial release has demonstrated its potential to redefine city exploration. Users can discover local attractions, explore neighborhoods, support small businesses, and participate in urban development initiatives. By integrating AI technologies, the app dynamically adjusts content, ensuring each tour is both engaging and relevant to the user's unique interests. Tokens are earned through active engagement, such as exploring areas, visiting businesses, and contributing to city development projects.

Currently, the app integrates React Native for cross-platform development and uses APIs like Google Maps and TripAdvisor for location-based services. Firebase manages authentication and database services, ensuring a secure and responsive experience. The project follows Agile methodologies, focusing on continuous user feedback and iterative improvement.

As an MVP, the app serves as the foundation for future features, such as decentralized governance for voting on city initiatives, personalized carbon-tracking rewards, and expanded partnerships with local businesses. This initial release sets the stage for scaling the platform to foster sustainable, interactive, and rewarding urban exploration that supports both community engagement and city improvement.
